# Words count

Write a function that given a `String` returns a data structure
containing each word and its number of occurrences in the
string.

For example, given `When I order pizza, I always order margherita`, we should get:

```
I: 2
order: 2
always: 1
margherita: 1
pizza: 1
when: 1
```

```swift
func wordsCount(_ input: String) -> [String: Int]
```
